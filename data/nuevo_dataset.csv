Impact of beta-blockers on long-term outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease;OBJECTIVES: This multicenter study evaluates the effect of beta-blocker therapy on mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease. METHODS: 500 patients were followed for 5 years, with clinical endpoints including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Beta-blockers remain a cornerstone in the management of coronary artery disease, improving long-term patient outcomes.
